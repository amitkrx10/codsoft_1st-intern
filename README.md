ðŸŽ¯ Project: Simple Calculator â€“ CodeSoft Internship Task 1
As part of my CodeSoft internship, I developed a Simple Calculator using Python. This tool performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while handling user input errors gracefully.
Key Features:
 âœ… User-friendly text-based interface
 âœ… Exception handling for invalid numeric input
 âœ… Division by zero prevention
 âœ… Clean and readable Python code
This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
Python programming fundamentals
User input validation
Writing maintainable code



ðŸŽ¯ Project: Random Password Generator â€“ CodeSoft Internship Task 2
As part of my CodeSoft internship, I created a Random Password Generator using Python. This project focuses on generating strong, unpredictable passwords to enhance security and reduce the risk of password-related breaches.
ðŸ”‘ Key Features:
Takes user input for desired password length
Ensures a minimum secure length (â‰¥ 4 characters)
Randomly combines:
Uppercase and lowercase letters
Digits
Special characters
Simple, clean terminal interface
Handles invalid inputs gracefully
ðŸ’¡ Skills Applied:
Python basics and built-in modules
Randomization logic with random and string libraries
User input validation and exception handling
Real-world utility for personal and professional use



ðŸŽ¯ Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game â€“ CodeSoft Internship Task 3
As part of my CodeSoft internship, I developed a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python that allows a user to play multiple rounds against the computer.
ðŸŽ® Key Features:
 âœ… Interactive console interface
 âœ… Validates user inputs to avoid errors
 âœ… Tracks and displays user and computer scores
 âœ… Handles multiple game rounds with the option to exit
 âœ… Uses Pythonâ€™s random module for fair computer choices
ðŸ’¡ Skills Strengthened:
Control flow and conditionals in Python
User input handling and validation
Game logic implementation
Use of loops and functions for modular code design


Iâ€™m excited to keep building more projects and growing my development skills!
